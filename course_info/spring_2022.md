## Classroom Platform Access 

This class uses Mimir. Note that since Mimir is terminating its support, we may transit to 
another platform along the way. All updates will be available in Piazza. 

### Accessing the CSE 480 Mimir classroom
Mimir is setup to use single sign on from D2L. To establish your mimir access please use the following steps:

1. Login to [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu)
2. Go to the CSE 480 classroom in D2L
3. On the main CSE 480 D2L Classroom page there is a section for "External Links". Expand that section.
4. Click the mimir link. This will take you to mimir and establish your access to the CSE 480 mimir classroom

Relational data models, database design principles, query languages, query optimization, 
transaction processing and recovery techniques. Object-oriented and distributed databases.

### Grading 
There will be 1000 points distributed thoughout the course via homework assignments and one exam. 
There will be no extra credit points.

### Requirements To Receive A Passing Grade

To be eligible to earn a non-zero grade in the course, a student normally must do ALL the following:

* Earn at least 50% (150 of 300 points) of the total points on the exam.

**Important**: Contact your instructor, if you have any concerns about your performance in the class.

### Course Platforms 

This course will use the Mimir system to deliver all homework assignments. 
Grades for homework assignments can be found in that system. Weekly videos 
stored in MSU's MediaSpace will be linked to this course website and are 
found in the [Schedule](#schedule) section.

Note: _Since Mimir is shutting down soon_, we are transitioning to another platform 
and we are still evaluating the capabilities of different platforms. We may 
switch to a different platform for later assignments. 

The exam which will be given approximately 2/3rds through the course will be delivered 
using the CSE Handin system (tentatively). Students will be monitored while taking the exam using zoom.

### Homeworks

There will be at least 13 weekly homeworks (currently through Mimir). 
The homeworks are intended to be straightforward if you have viewed the lectures. 
Only your top 10 homework scores will count toward your final grade; all others 
will be dropped. The counted scores will each be worth 700 points for a total of 
70% of your final grade. Homeworks are always due the Monday or Thursday after 
they are assigned at 10pm. Homework assignments **must** be submitted prior to the 
deadline to be graded.

### Exam 

The exam will occur approximately 2/3 of the way through the semester (see the Schedule) 
and will cover all of the material to that point. It will be worth 300 points 
(30% of your final grade). We will have a practice exam at least one week before 
the actual exam that will closely resemble it so that you know exactly what to expect. 
There will be no final exam.

### The Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

> As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. 
I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride 
in knowing that honor in ownership is worth more than grades. I will carry these
values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the 
endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

### Collaboration On Coding Assignments

Each assignment submission is electronically and manually compared to all other 
solutions (in this course and previous offerings) to identify similar solutions.

**Under no circumstances should you share any part of an assignment solution with 
another student. Simply showing your solution to another student almost guarantees 
detection by the plagiarism software: past experience shows that a student who asks 
to "look at" your solution will copy parts of it or pass it along to someone 
else who copies it.**

Plagiarism (unsourced use of other's intellectual property) is not allowed. 
However, citing and using other's works is generally fine (please ask if uncertain) as 
long as the material wasn't made specificly for solving assignments for this class. 
Additionally, the use of material from previous semesters and code from other students 
in the class are explicitly instances of academic dishonesty. Intellectual collaboration 
with other students in the class is allowed, but each student should write (and not share) 
their own code. If a student submits code that they don't understand, 
such is also an act of academic dishonesty.

### Academic Dishonesty

Because a goal of this course is to teach professionalism, any academic dishonesty 
will be viewed as evidence that this goal has not been achieved, and will be grounds 
for receiving a final grade of 0.0. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to):

* Copying another student's code or exam answers
* Using code implemented by someone else intended to solve this class's assignments (i.e., don't get someone else to do your assignment for you!).
* Using code independently implemented by someone else without attributing credit (i.e., you can use tools, libraries, or code snippets from the web, but only with proper citation.)
* Writing code that deceptively passes the test cases, but doesn't solve the problem given. In other words, abusing automatic grader mechanisms to gain unearned points.
* Using websites and sources, whose purpose is to provide assignment solutions (e.g. using sites such as Chegg.com for any purpose regarding this class).
* Distributing course content without instructor permission.
* Having someone that isn't an instructor or TA aid you in implementing a solution to an assignment or exam.
* Submitting a solution that you don't understand / can't explain to an instructor.
* Using assignment solutions provided to a previous iteration of this course.
* Providing false information to the instructor about matters related to the course.
* Facilitating another student in any of these activities.
* See [Academic Dishonesty and Attribution](https://github.com/jiayuzhou/CSE480/blob/main/course_info/dishonesty_cases.md) for more details.

### Grief Absence Policy
If their occur unfortunate circumstances that would lead you to have unexpected absences, 
MSU has a [Grief Absence Policy](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Notices/GriefAbsence.aspx). 
You need to contact the Associate Dean, and we will make 
every effort to aid you in continuing the class after we recieve confirmation from the administration.

### Incomplete Grades
According to the university, the grade of "incomplete" is reserved for "exceptional cases, 
where an unanticipated event beyond one's control interferes with a student's completion of course requirements."

### Regrades
Requests for regrading can go in either direction; we are often generous when we first grade something,
so please be sure that we did make a mistake before you submit your request. On the other hand, 
our goal is for you to understand the course material, so we will always be willing to explain 
to you any portion that you are stuck on. All requests for regrades must come within one week 
of the return of the graded item. Thereafter, no requests will be considered, so be sure to 
pick up your returned assignments on time.

### Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities
Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opprotunity for participation in all programs, 
services and activities. Requests for acommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting 
the [Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities](http://rcpd.msu.edu/) at 517-884-RCPD. 
Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified 
individual services accommodation ("VISA") form. Please present this form to me at the start of
the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (exam, project, etc.). 
Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.

### Commercialized Lecture Notes
Commercialization of lecture notes and university-provided course materials is not permitted in this course.

### General Note
The goal of this class is for you to learn. If you find that anything is 
coming in your way of that goal, please talk with us about it. We plan to 
keep the class flexible to the learning styles that seem to work best for 
the students, so feedback is always appreciated.
